# Git instructions

To check the changes do
git status

To add the files do
git add <file_name>

If you want to add all the files, do
git add . 

Then you need to commit using
git commit -m "<commit_message>"

Then push the changes
git push

If there is a conflict while pushing,
it is probably because you have not
pulled the lastest chnages on the repo.

Try to do
git pull

You might need to resolve merge conflicts.
